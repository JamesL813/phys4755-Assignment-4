## 1)

4.11: Plot u vs x obtained from all three solutions and compare to see if there
are differences.

Apply the Numerov Algorithm to solve:
$$ u"(x)=-4\pi^2u(x)$$
With $u(0)=1$ and $u'(0)=0$. Discuss the accuracy of the result by comparing it 
with the solution obtained via the fourth degree Runge-Kutta algorithm and with
the exact result

## 2)

4.12: Plot u vs x obtained from the exact solution and from the shooting method and compare to see if there are differences. 

Apply the Shooting Method to solve the eigenvalue problem
$$ u"(x)=\lambda u(x)$$

Atomic units (a.u.), that is, $m_e = e = h = c = 1$, $x_0 = 5$ a.u., and $V_0 =
50$ a.u. can be used.

## 3)

In this problem we will solve the one-dimensional time independent Schrödinger
equation (Eq. 4.91 in your text) using two different methods. Consider a single
electron of mass $m_e$ in one dimension trapped in a potential well of the
following form:

It's simplest to use atomic units (a.u.) with Set the potential parameters to be
and

### a)
Use the code from Chapter 4.9 of the text (which uses the Numerov algorithm with
secant method) to find the two lowest eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the
Schrödinger equation with the above potential.

### b)
Then develop a program that does the same thing as part a), but with the
Runge-Kutta and secant methods.

### c)
To compare results from parts a) and b), plot the square of the eigenfunctions
versus position for both methods to see if there are differences.

Comment: The solutions to Problem 3 (and variants) are now commonly used in
semiconductor device modeling. See, e.g.,
